Interactive Button Effects
Description
This project features interactive button effects using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Buttons are initialized with the "enabled" class and respond dynamically to mouse hover and click events. When hovered over, buttons toggle a hover effect, and when clicked, they transition between the "enabled" and "disabled" states, with disabled buttons appending a ðŸ˜‚ emoji to their text content.
